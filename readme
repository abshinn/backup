backup.py

PURPOSE
  Not intended as version control or timemachine, but as an extra means to backup code.
  Backup.py searches user-secified directories for specifed file extensions, and stores
  those files as binary strings in pickled file, in a specified location. Personally, I
  have backup.py send the pickled backups to a network drive.
